- get rid of pkgconfig (it doesnt work on Fedora), just `-lasound` will work tho
- fix play/pause on android
- check if opensles still works
- make AudioContext on linux/mac/windows/sles nicer
- refactor AudioContext API, move play from Sound to Context
- remove "*" from Cargo.toml
- add basic resampling to mixer (make sure that 1 channel/non-44100 files works fine)
- fix wasm build
- do all the deinitialisation code. It is missed in alsa/wasapi/coreaudio
